# Connected Graph

This program implements a simple graph of integer values as an adjacency matrix. The 
graph class contains a method to determine whether the graph is connected or not by 
conducting a recursive depth-first-search.

Included are two sample adjacency list files which may be used to generate graphs, 
although the program will accept any text file containing an adjacency list of integers 
to generate a graph.
